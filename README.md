## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

### Software can only be considered complete when it is both functioning as intended and secure in its ability to fulfill its function. I ensure that my programs are working as intended by testing them across a wide range of different scenarios and inputs. This includes testing that it performs the correct actions when provided inputs or data that falls within acceptable bounds and that it can handled incorrect data and inputs without shutting down or locking out the user. This requires insight into what could possibly go wrong, writing tests to simulate that scenario, and then ensuring the system is able to handle those scenarios gracefully. There are various different testing techniques that could utilize to test the software for functionality and secureness. It ws my job to incorporate the most appropriate techniques for the software at hand. 

## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

### When developing for a customer, the user needs are the most important aspect to get right. If you do not meet the needs of the customer, the software risks being useless and a waste of development time. I find it important to not only get the user requirements but to also understand them to get the true spirit of what the user needs. This can involve interviewing the end user or business client to get more indepth knowledge of what they need or I could have a mock up design of what I understand to be the reqirements in action. I can then present this to the user to see if it matches what they envisioned. Involving the user of the software is vital. Thier feedback can ultimatley save time from needless reworks and developing the requirements incorreclty. 

## How do I approach designing software?

### I design software with user requirements as the main focus. I do my best to understand not what the requirements are telling me but what the goal of those requirements are. I also then focus testing around these requirements to ensure they are functioning as intended and not accepting data outside of its acceptable parameters. The user requirements of the "what" of the project but I find that knowing the "why" can lead to a deeper understanding which can guide development closer to most fully realized version of the desired software.
